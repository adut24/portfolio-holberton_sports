## What's Holberton Sports
Holberton Sports is a Virtual Reality game made on Unity. Taking inspiration from the Nintendo Wii's launch title, Wii Sports, the game will feature in its final version 3 sports:
- Bowling
- Archery
- Table Tennis

The purpose of this game is to be a pleasant way for people to discover VR and its controls. The sports in this game can be played alone or with another player (who must have their own headset).
